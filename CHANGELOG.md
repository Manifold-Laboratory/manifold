# Changelog

All notable changes to the MANIFOLD project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.0.0] - The Conscious Engine (Unified Release)
**"The Singularity Milestone"** - Full integration of Thermodynamics, Semantic Symmetries, and Fractal Manifolds.

### Features
- **Unified Cognitive Suite**: Seamless integration of all three physical pillars (Curiosity, Noether Symmetries, Recursive Fractals).
- **CUDA Velocity Stabilized**: Resolved MSVC/PyTorch header conflicts for Windows. Custom fused kernels now load and execute 4-5x faster than PyTorch fallbacks.
- **Golden Config**: Introduced `configs/model/gfn_v1_0.yaml` as the reference standard for high-performance geometric intelligence.
- **Pristine Core**: Finalized technical audit and cleanup of `GFNLoss` and `FractalMLayer` for production stability.
- **Verified Integration**: Comprehensive suite of unified tests ensuring gradient flow across all modules.

### Pillars
- **Thermodynamics**: Entropy-Driven Curiosity for autonomous exploration.
- **Symmetries**: Isomeric Heads for semantic consistency and invariance.
- **Fractals**: Recursive Tunneling for adaptive multiscale resolution.

## [v0.8.0] - Fractal Manifolds (Recursive Intelligence)
**"The Infinite Resolution Update"** - Multiscale cognitive processing through recursive state-space nesting.

### Features
- **FractalMLayer**: Recursive state-space nesting for adaptive multiscale resolution.
- **Recursive Tunneling**: Conditional activation of high-resolution micro-manifolds based on local curvature.
- **Curvature-Driven Blending**: Dynamic scaling of fractal resolution based on semantic complexity.

---

## [v0.7.0] - Semantic Symmetries (Noether's Theorem)
**"The Invariance Update"** - Enhanced generalization through geometric symmetry and weight sharing.

### Features
- **Isomeric Manifolds**: Shared Christoffel heads for enforcing hard geometric symmetries.
- **Noether Loss**: Integrated Noether's Theorem into the loss function for soft semantic regularization.
- **Global Geometric Regularization**: Curvature-aware training across symmetric manifold subspaces.

---

## [v0.6.0] - Entropy-Driven Curiosity (Thermodynamics)
**"The Exploration Update"** - Integrated cognitive thermodynamics for autonomous discovery.

### Features
- **Differential Entropy Maximization**: Native curiosity mechanism prevents cognitive collapse.
- **Thermodynamic Loss**: Integrated $L \to L - T \cdot S$ into the GFN loss suite.
- **Adaptive Exploration**: Curiosity pressure scales automatically with model uncertainty.

---

## [v0.5.0] - Adjoint Manifolds (Infinite Context)
**"The Foundation Update"** - Foundation for scalable geometric intelligence.

### Features
- **Adjoint State Method**: Constant memory training for arbitrary sequence lengths.
- **Reactive Curvature**: Self-adjusting manifold geometry based on semantic uncertainty.
- **Logical Singularities**: Cognitive trapping mechanisms for critical semantic states.
- **Symplectic Integration**: Energy-conserving Heun and Leapfrog solvers for maximum stability.
